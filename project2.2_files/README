# Compiling
    - The program compiles with my Makefile
    - I was able to fix the initial seg fault however more problems followed
    - IMPORTANT: When you compile with the command my program WILL COUT AN ANSWER TO THE COMMAND IF YOU SCROLL TO THE TOP
    and BELOW it was list reasons for seg faulting, it will say MEMORY READ ERROR
    unfortunately, I could not find where I was going out of bounds, I knew the problem
    and I knew where it was located but I could not understand why an error was happening
    my hashtable was thoroughly tested and I made sure all constructors and assignment
    operators were working. I tried to step through but could not acertain what caused
    my hashtable to go out of bounds.

# Class Changes 
    - I mentionened it before in the files, but if I treated a file as an interface, I removed
    its constructors because interfaces should not have have constructors
    - Subway Portal now has defined move/copy contructor and move/copy assignment operator

## HashTable class Changes
    - find now returned either -1 (if not found) or the position of the item
        - I made this change because I believed it was the easiest way to get the postion of the item
        in the array of parent trees
    - parameters of find, insert, and remove are marked as const reference to minimize copying
    - an r-value insert has been added for temporary object insertion (works the same as regular insert)
    - an public empty() function was added to check for emptiness (it was for my testing)

# Other modifications
    - const methods removed from SubwaySystem as in piazza it was mentioned that they give errors
    - I took the files you gave us including subwaystation and made them abstract, when I created the derived classes I marked the methods "final" 

# Makefile
    - I had some extra files that should not have been compiled so I made SRCS the cpp files I know I needed
    - Added -no-pie -Iincludes in CXXFLAGS because it would not compile otherwise
    - added -fsanitize=address,undefined which helped a lot in finding the initial 
    seg fault and shifting errors.
    - added messages to better see which files were compiling correctly

# Includes changes for linking
    - class SubwayStation at the top of SubwayPortal was removed (it was producing a warning)
    - #include "SubwaySystem.h" in SubwayStation.h (I might have put it there) because it was giving a linking error 

# Lists and Sets
    - I kept the set of station names and only converted to lists after sets were formed
    - I modified children/station names after sets were formed as reccommended in the PDF
    - Subway System has two private methods added "

# Moments
    - I had a big "wow" moment went I carefult looked at the data set and realized how I wanted to get the data
    - I was stuck on doing a Union and Find on the stations, but when I thought a solution, I felt really happy
    well in the sense that I thought I implemented everything. 
    - Again, I want to believe I implemented everything to the best of my ability.
