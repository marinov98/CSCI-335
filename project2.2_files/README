# Compiling

# Changes 
    - I mentionened it before in the files, but if I treated a file as an interface, I removed
    its constructors because interfaces should not have have constructors

## HashTable class Changes
    - find now returned either -1 (if not found) or the position of the item
        - I made this change because I believed it was the easiest way to get the postion of the item
        in the array of parent trees
    - parameters of find, insert, and remove are marked as const reference to minimize copying
    - an r-value insert has been added for temporary object insertion (works the same as regular insert)
    - an public empty() function was added to check for emptiness (it was for my testing)

# Other modifications
    - const methods removed from SubwaySystem as in piazza it was mentioned that they give errors
    - I took the files you gave us including subwaystation and made them abstract, when I created the derived
    classes I marked the methods "final" 

# Makefile
    - I had some extra files that should not have been compiled so I made SRCS the cpp files I know I needed
    - Added -no-pie -Iincludes in CXXFLAGS because it would not compile otherwise

# Includes changes for linking
    - class SubwayStation at the top of SubwayPortal was removed (it was producing a warning)
    - #include "SubwaySystem.h" in SubwayStation.h (I might have put it there) because it was giving a linking error 

# Bit mask strategy
    - 1-7 are mapped to bits 1-7, GS and FS are mapped to bits 8 and 9, A-Z are mapped to bits 10-35

# Lists and Sets
    - I kept the set of station names and only converted to lists after sets were formed
    - I modified children/station names after sets were formed as reccommended in the PDF
    - Subway System has two private methods added "
